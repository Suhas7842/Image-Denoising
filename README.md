# Image-Denoising Using Auto-Encoders

## About the Dataset

* Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 samples. 

## Libraries Used
* Tensorflow
* Matplotlib
* Numpy 
* Random

* Used CNN (Convolutional Neural networks) and RelU Activation function on Fashion-MNIST Dataset to denoise the images.

* Our project outputs de-noised images directly, we can visually compare the difference between Noised and De-noised images. We can evaluate the difference between images through image properties like white balance, reduced noise spots, and sharper edges of the image subjects.

* Our Image denoiser is a prototype software that can denoise the images of resolution 28X28 in grayscale.
